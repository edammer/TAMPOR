# Tunable Approach for Median Polish of Ratio -- Biological Abundance Batch Effect Removal
## (TAMPOR), by Eric Dammer
For public use with citation of origin, and original author
####
## Purpose
####
#### - Robustly removes batch artifacts and batchwise variance from abundance data.
#### - Works well even if batch replicates for normalization have unusual variance compared to biological samples not used for normalization (e.g., due to differential peptide digestion, different tissue region, or different genetic background of control samples.)
####
## General Use Cases
####
#### 1. Batch replicates (e.g., global internal standard, GIS, in TMT proteomics) if present are baseline samples considered as ratio denominator for removal of batch artifacts.
#### 2. Consider biologically similar samples as baseline for the denominator.    [set a GIS column in traits input]
#### 3. Third, baseline samples present can be used, and all other samples can also be used. This assumes batches are generally trait-balanced and randomized, but GIS and non-GIS samples can be grossly different.    [useAllNonGIS=TRUE]
#### 4. Last, if batches consist of trait-randomized and generally trait-balanced biological samples, all samples can be considered for baseline/denominator.    [noGIS=TRUE]

####  **_inputs_**: 
| data frame or matrix              | Description                                       |
|:----------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| 1. (normalized or RAW) abundance  | columns named by samples, rows by measured species|
| 2. traits / phenotypes            | columns named by traits, rows named by sample     |

 *Sample names as column and row names in abundance and traits, respectively, must match exactly.*
####
####  **_outputs_**:  (as list, with the following elements)
####
### FOR DOWNSTREAM ANALYSIS
| list element | Description|
| ------------:|:-----------|
| cleanRelAbun | abundance within-batch across batch batch-corrected|
|     cleanDat | log2(cleanRelAbun/row's central tendency of abundance) |
|              | (rows with 50%+ missing batches/values removed from the above.)|
|       traits | case-sample traits, of used samples, sorted and annotated |
####
### FOR COMPARISON/DIAGNOSTICS, VISUALIZATION
|        list element      | Description|
|     --------------------:|:-----------|
|     cleanDat.oneIter     | log2 of naive ratio, applying algorithm without iteration      |
|     cleanRelAbun.oneIter | naive ratio, converted back to abundance                       |
|     converged            | TRUE/FALSE, was convergence reached in the median polishing?   |
|     iterations           | Number of median polish iterations performed                   |

|     **meanSDplots**      | **vsn package mean-SD plots of variance for:**                 |
|                          |   a. input abundance of same dimensions as output              |
|                          |   b. cleanRelAbun.oneIter                                      |
|                          |   c. corrected abundance (cleanRelAbun)                        |
|     **MDSplots**         | **limma multi-dimensional scaling plots for:**                 |
|                          |   a. input abundance with same dimensions as output            |
|                          |   b. cleanRelAbun.oneIter                                      |
|                          |   c. corrected abundance (cleanRelAbun)                        |

**The 3 last list elements above render the graphics of the PDF output pages.**

     If removeGISafter option not enabled, variance and MDS plots each display with and without GIS.
